# Adapt the script to your requirements.
# The data volume for all pressure level data is about 5GB per day, and all pressure level data for more than a single day will exceed the WebAPI limit of 600.000 fields. Thus please restrict the download to what you really need.
# It is likely you need to split your request, this is best done by time periods, ie. first download for month 1, then for month 2, etc.
